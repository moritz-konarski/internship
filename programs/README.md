# Internship Programs

## GUI Program

This is the main result of the internship. The folder contains all the python
files that are part of the program. The `internship_gui.yml` file contains the
anaconda environment information required to execute the program. Once the
environment is activated, navigate to the folder and type `python3 main.py` to
execute it.

## Command Line Program

The programs in this folder are presented to show my work, they are not up to
date and they may not even work. The required anaconda environment file is
provided in case there is interest in them.
