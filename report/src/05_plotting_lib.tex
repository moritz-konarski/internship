\section{Data Investigation}

I think that you should have Results section in your report where you will
analyze those satellite data. May be seasonal variations. Day/Night min max
values or spatial variations. Or even vertical structure of air temperature
I suggest you to explore vertical structure of air temperature. Show tropopause
zone. Show vertical gradient of temperature and why it is so. Show stratopause
zone and explain inverse of gradient due to ozone layer. There is a lot of info
about these zones and you can easily find it, and add good photos, graphs from
Internet to have more interesting presentation. It will be not just software
work but also with some scientific taste.
