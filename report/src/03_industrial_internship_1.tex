\subsubsection{Registration}

To access data on the NASA Earthdata platform (which includes GES DISC),
a registered account is required. The purpose of the registration is for NASA
to improve their service and to offer notifications and saved preferences.

The Earthdata account then needs to be linked to a GES DISC account to access
the M2I3NPASM dataset I am working with. A full guide can be found under 
\href{https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/}{this url}.

\subsubsection{Downloading}

To actually download GES DISC Data there are many options, but \texttt{wget}
might be preferable. \texttt{wget} is a utility for downloading files from the
internet. It is generally used as a command line tool and it is available for
most platforms. The steps necessary to set up wget to download data from GES
DISC are outlined 
\href{https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access#mac_linux_wget}{here}. The process
simply involves setting up your login information in a local file.
