# TODO List

- [ ] next step: create a UI sketch using Balsamiq
    - [ ] submit it to him and the group
    - [ ] the group decides what we should use
    - [ ] then we start coding
- [x] create a doc for setting up account and credentials
- [x] make download\_helper portable with proper env file
- [x] write doc on how to use 
- [x] send diary to advisor
- [ ] write plotter for 1 var of netcdf
- [ ] try out spyder -- because it is for scientific development
    - professional IDEs will help you too much
- [ ] translate exercises to be sure what I am expected to do
- [ ] he wants me to make a window application with menus etc
    - use PyQt5 for the windowing
    - we should maybe start with Tkinter, then PyQt5
    - maybe PySide -- see which one fits this best
    - file/dir chooser
    - plot button
    - convert to different files (csv etc)
    - make a sketch before we start coding -- maybe by hand or using some UI
    tool -- use Balsamiq to do that
- [ ] he wants us to use OOP for the stuff
- [ ] we will be working with a certain subregion that basically includes KG
- [ ] agree on who will download which part of a year -- split 2020 between the
three of us -- download all the vars and levels for all data
- find out what levels are -- altitude levels from the surface to space
- try to combine all the files we download into one file -- so we can
continuously access variables through time
- time series for plot -- time on x, pressure on y
- see if all the data can be held in one file -- maybe we need files for each
of the variables individually

## Task for 23.09.2020

- make a proper slack channel for the project coordination
- use Spyder as an IDE
- make a plan for what we want to do with the team members -- we should not do
all the work 3 times
- we should all do a small but useful part of the project
- download data for this year -- find an efficient structure for the data
- plot a heatmap or a time series
- try to plot
- make a Balsamiq sketch
