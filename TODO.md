- [ ] create templates for data retrieval for plotting
    - [ ] get var list () -> [str]
    - [ ] get var type
    - [ ] get var unit
    - [ ] get coordinate range (var) [lat\_min, lat\_max, lon\_min, lon\_max]
    - [ ] get time range (var)
    - [ ] get time series (start\_time, end\_time, var, area=[], lev?)
    - [ ] get heat map (time, area, var, lev?)
    - get all data within certain constraints: greater than, smaller than ...
- [ ] find a good data structure until Friday
    - tether, hdf, pickle, etc
    - Parquet, ORC, Arrow
- [ ] to be more scientific, we should implement some better analysis features:
    - statistics
    - spectral analysis
    - other time series analysis tools
