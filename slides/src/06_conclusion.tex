\section{Conclusion}

During this 2 month internship at RS RAS Bishkek I studied how
one can access NASA satellite data, which formats they come in, and how to work
with said data. I also learned how to develop a program that can read, process,
export, and plot the satellite data using Python and the relevant libraries.
All of these skills will be very useful for my future.\\
Before this internship, I never realized how simple it was to access satellite
NASA data, which I always thought was very interesting. Furthermore, these
skills could be useful for either future research I might do or for a job
I might have. Gaining experience with scientific data formats like netCDF and
the libraries used to work with these formats falls into the same category.\\
Developing a Python program using a popular GUI library is also a valuable
skill to have, especially because I study Applied Mathematics and
\textit{Informatics} and might work in that field as well.\\
To conclude I think that I learned many useful skills during my internship that
will help me be a better student and maybe even a better researcher one day.
